What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.
JDK stands for Java development Kit, it contains-
# Java runtime environment (JRE)
( JRE takes Java code, combines it with necessary libraries and start the JVM to execute it. )
* Java Virtual Machine ( JVM )
( JVM verifies and executes java bytecode. First compiler compiles the code and generate bytecode
and then inter convert the bytecode to machine understandable code. )
* The Just-In_Time ( JIT )
( Its a component that compile bytecodes to native codes at Run Time )
* Core Libraries
( The core libraries consists of classes which are used by many properties of the JDK. )
# Compiler
( Compiler convert source code to byte code )
# Debugger
( Debugger allows user to halt the program and examine the value of variable in the execution line by line. )
# Disassembler
( Java Disassembler disassemble the Java bytecode after compiled.
And then information about the Member Variable and Methods are printed. )

What is IDE?
A. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software allows user to
   write, execute and debug Java program.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, IntelliJ, Netbeans.



Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. At Editing Time-----
   * we write the program and save it .java file.
   At compile time----
   * Compiler convert source code (.java) to .class file which is byte code.
   Also known as machine independent or platform independent code
   At Runtime-------
   * JIT compile the bytecode to native code which will execute by CPU

what is class?
A. A class is a blueprint for an object.

What is object?
A. Instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main method.

Why main is static?

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
What is final, finally and finalize?

What is a constructor ?
A. Special type of method that is used to initialize the state of an object in a class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. Default Constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. Refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
A. Yes.

What version of java are you using?

What is JAR stand for ?
Java ARchive.


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. JDK is for development purposes and JVM is responsible for converting the byte code to the machine-specific code.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE is for running the java programs. JVM provides platform independence.

What is compile time and run time?


What is heap?
A. Runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects.

How java manage it's memory?
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

What is Singleton class?
A. Object hiding.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
when to use transient variable in java?

Difference between while and do..while loop?

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. Both are unit testing frameworks, however for TestNG parallel testing is possible.

What are the dependencies for this project?
what is dependency injection in java?

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. Static binding is resolved at compile time (Method Overloading). Dynamic binding is resolved at run time (Method Overriding).
