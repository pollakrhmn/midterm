Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.To store organizing information.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. cTraversing - Searching - Inserting - Deleting - Sorting - Merging - Traversing.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. 1.Compiler Design
   2.Operating System
   3.Database Management System
   4.Statistical analysis package
   5.Numerical Analysis
   6.Graphics
   7.Artificial Intelligence
   8.Simulation


what is an Array?
A. An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array is fixed in size while an ArrayList is dynamically growing.

what is LinkedList?
A. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list,
location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/nod

what is queue?
A. A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue,
   and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.

what is stack?
A. It is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. First in first out, last in first out

what is the order of complexity?
A. Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes depending on the amount of input data.
   The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(nÂ²).

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. Sequential search is the best that we can do when trying to find a value in an unsorted array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst-case performance is when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.
   This would require N comparisons, hence, the worse case is O(N).

what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
